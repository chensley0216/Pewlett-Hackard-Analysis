# Pewlett Hackard Analysis Report
 
<b>Overview of the analysis:</b>

The purpose of this analysis is to use provided data to determine how many employees per title will be retiring and how many of those employees will be eligible for participation in a mentorship program.  

<b>Results:</b>

<i>Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables:</i>

There are four important points to note from the analysis that led to determining how many employees would be eligible to participate in a mentorship program:

•	Creation of a retirement titles table allowed us to separate data from the original pool. We combined specific data that would be usable for our project into this new table using JOIN, where we joined together columns from the employees and titles tables.

•	Creation of a unique titles table allowed us to determine how many titles were used in the data so that we could then count how many employees used each title.

•	Using the Distinct On command, we were able to retrieve rows of data and then remove any duplicates, thereby cleaning up the data.

•	By using filters on the data, we were able to gather data based on specific requirements for the mentorship program.  We could group employees based on a range of birth dates or start dates.

<b>Summary:</b> 

<i>How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?</i>

Around 90,000 roles in the company will need to be filled in the coming years due to the “silver tsunami” of retirees.  

<i>Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?</i>

There are thousands of retirement-ready employees in every department except for managers.  The position of manager only has two retiring employees – a number that is not sufficient with mentoring another generation.
